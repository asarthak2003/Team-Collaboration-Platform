## ✨ What Makes Collabra Special?
Unlike bulky enterprise tools that require weeks of onboarding, Collabra hits the perfect sweet spot between **power** and **simplicity**. 
* **Zero-Lag Communication:** Live WebSocket chat inside every single task means no more context switching to external messaging apps. When a task updates, your team knows instantly.
* **Beautifully Dark:** A meticulously crafted dark-theme UI using TailwindCSS that reduces eye strain, looks incredibly premium, and feels snappy thanks to Vite and React 19.
* **Cloud-Ready Storage:** Dynamic, interface-driven storage adapters allow you to instantly switch between local disk storage for rapid development and Cloudinary for globally distributed production delivery.
* **Deploy Anywhere:** Architected from the ground up to be container-native. Our custom Dockerfiles leverage Alpine Linux and Eclipse Temurin to keep image sizes tiny and startup times lightning fast.

## 🌟 Comprehensive Features

### 📋 Project & Task Management
* **Hierarchical Organization:** Group tasks inside detailed Projects to maintain clean scopes and clear deliverables.
* **Kanban Workflow:** Visually track tasks across lifecycle stages (To Do, In Progress, Review, Testing, Done, Blocked) to identify bottlenecks.
* **Smart Assignments & Ownership:** Assign tasks to specific team members with dynamic priority levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical). Filter your dashboard to see only what matters to you.
* **Due Dates & Time Tracking:** Set hard deadlines. The system tracks exact timestamps for when tasks were created, updated, and completed for auditing purposes.

### 💬 Real-Time Collaboration
* **Live Task Chat:** Instant messaging built directly into the Task Details panel using STOMP WebSockets.
* **Threaded Comments:** Leave permanent, threaded feedback on tasks for long-form discussions that don't belong in the fast-paced chat.
* **Instant Presence:** Connection indicators show when the live chat broker is actively connected.

### 📁 Secure File Management
* **Cloud Attachments:** Seamlessly upload images, PDFs, and documents directly to tasks or projects.
* **Auto-Optimization:** Powered by Cloudinary, uploaded assets are automatically optimized for web delivery to save bandwidth.
* **Strict Access Control:** Only assigned users or platform Admins can delete sensitive files, preventing accidental data loss.

### 🔒 Advanced Security & RBAC
* **Role-Based Access Control:** Three distinct tiers (Admin, Project Manager, Member) to lock down sensitive actions like project creation and user deletion.
* **Stateless Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) ensure secure, stateless API interactions without relying on server-side sessions.
* **Cryptographic Hashing:** Industry-standard BCrypt hashing (strength 10) for all user credentials ensures passwords are unrecoverable even in a breach.

## 📊 Core Database Schema (ERD)

Collabra relies on a fully relational PostgreSQL database mapped via Spring Data JPA. Here is a high-level Entity Relationship Diagram:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USERS ||--o{ PROJECTS : "creates"
    USERS ||--o{ TASKS : "assigned / creates"
    USERS ||--o{ COMMENTS : "writes"
    ROLES ||--|{ USERS : "has"
    PROJECTS ||--o{ TASKS : "contains"
    TASKS ||--o{ COMMENTS : "has"
    TASKS ||--o{ ATTACHMENTS : "has"
    TASKS ||--o{ CHAT_MESSAGES : "has"

    USERS {
        Long id PK
        String email UK
        String password
        Long role_id FK
    }
    PROJECTS {
        Long id PK
        String name
        String status
        Long created_by FK
    }
    TASKS {
        Long id PK
        String title
        String status
        String priority
        Long project_id FK
        Long assigned_user_id FK
    }
```

## ⚙️ Environment Configuration Guide

To run Collabra successfully, you must configure the following environment variables. The system will safely fall back to defaults where appropriate, but production environments require all of them.

| Variable Name | Description | Example Value | Required |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| `DB_URL` | The JDBC connection string for PostgreSQL. | `jdbc:postgresql://ep-neon...` | Yes |
| `DB_USERNAME` | Database user with read/write access. | `neondb_owner` | Yes |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | Database password. | `super_secret_db_pass` | Yes |
| `JWT_SECRET` | A 256-bit+ secure key for signing auth tokens. | `my_long_jwt_secret_key_...` | Yes |
| `STORAGE_TYPE` | Defines the file storage adapter. | `cloudinary` (or `local`) | No |
| `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` | Your unique Cloudinary identifier. | `collabra_project` | If Cloudinary |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` | Public API key for Cloudinary. | `123456789012345` | If Cloudinary |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`| Secret API key for Cloudinary. | `abcDEFghiJKLmno` | If Cloudinary |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Limits API access to your specific frontend. | `https://your-vercel.app` | Yes (Prod) |

## 🔌 API Integration & WebSockets

Collabra uses both traditional REST and real-time WebSockets to deliver a snappy experience.

### WebSocket Broker (STOMP)
* **Endpoint:** `/ws-chat`
* **Topic Subscription:** Clients subscribe to `/topic/task/{taskId}` to listen for incoming messages specific to that task.
* **Publishing:** Clients send JSON payloads to `/app/chat.sendMessage` which the Spring Boot `SimpMessagingTemplate` broadcasts to the relevant topic.

### Key REST Endpoints
* `POST /api/auth/login` - Authenticate and receive a JWT token (Bearer).
* `GET /api/projects` - Retrieve all projects the authenticated user has access to.
* `POST /api/attachments/upload?taskId={id}` - Expects `multipart/form-data`. Streams directly to Cloudinary.
* `GET /api/tasks/{taskId}/chat` - Retrieves historical chat messages before the WebSocket connection takes over.

## 🛡️ Security & Authentication Flow

Collabra takes security seriously, implementing defense-in-depth at multiple layers:
1. **Authentication:** Upon successful login, the server generates a JWT signed with HMAC-SHA256. This token contains the user's ID and Role.
2. **Authorization:** Every incoming request is intercepted by the `JwtAuthenticationFilter`. If valid, the user's security context is populated.
3. **Controller Security:** Endpoints are protected using `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")` or custom logic to ensure users can only modify tasks they own or manage.
4. **CORS Protection:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is strictly limited to the configured `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, preventing unauthorized domains from interacting with the API.

## 🔑 Demo Credentials

To test the application immediately (either locally or on your live URL) without registering new accounts, you can use these preconfigured test credentials mapping to the three core system roles:

*   **Admin User** (Full platform read/write & deletion controls):
    *   **Email:** `admin@admin.com`
    *   **Password:** `admin`
*   **Manager User** (Can create and manage tasks/projects):
    *   **Email:** `manager1@manager1.com`
    *   **Password:** `manager1`
*   **Member User** (Standard task assignment, execution & comments):
    *   **Email:** `member1@member1.com`
    *   **Password:** `member1`
